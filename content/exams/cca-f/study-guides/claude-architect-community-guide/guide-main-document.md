# Claude Certified Architect — Foundations

Anthropic's technical certification for solution architects building production applications with Claude (exam code **CCAR-F**). 60 multiple-choice, scenario-based questions in 120 minutes, proctored and closed-book. Passing score: 720/1000. Candidates answer questions from 4 of 6 randomly selected scenarios. No penalty for guessing.

Part of a four-credential family: [Claude Certified Associate — Foundations (CCAO-F)](certs/ccao-f-associate.md), **Architect — Foundations (CCAR-F)** — this guide, [Architect — Professional (CCAR-P)](certs/ccar-p-architect-professional.md), and [Developer — Foundations (CCDV-F)](certs/ccdv-f-developer.md). Delivered via Pearson VUE (OnVUE online or test center), registered through the Anthropic Partner Academy. Per Exam Guide v1.0 (effective July 2026): $125 per attempt, certification valid 12 months, up to 4 attempts per rolling 12 months (14/30/90-day waits after attempts 1–3). Renewal is free when done on time — review what changed since you certified and pass a non-proctored assessment; let it lapse and the full exam fee applies again. Access remains gated to the Claude Partner Network (registration needs a partner-domain email); the earlier "$99, first 5,000 partner employees free" beta terms are superseded.

Target: Solution architect with 6+ months experience with Claude APIs, Agent SDK, Claude Code, and MCP.

## Current Model Lineup (September 2026)

The exam is model-agnostic, but scenario questions and code samples assume a current lineup. This guide's samples use **`claude-opus-5`**.

| Model | ID | Context | Max output | Price (in / out per MTok) | Notes |
|-------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------------------|-------|
| Claude Fable 5.1 | `claude-fable-5-1` | 1M | 128k | $10 / $50 (cache reads $0.25) | Most capable widely released model (2026-09-01); thinking always on; **no forced `tool_choice`**; thinking blocks bound to model + history |
| **Claude Opus 5** | `claude-opus-5` | 1M | 128k | $5 / $25 | **Default for complex agentic coding and enterprise work** |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `claude-sonnet-5` | 1M | 128k | $2 / $10 | Best speed/intelligence balance; no mid-conversation system messages, no task budgets |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | 200k | 64k | $1 / $5 | Fastest; only current model still using `budget_tokens` thinking; no `effort` |

Claude Mythos 5.1 (`claude-mythos-5-1`) shares Fable 5.1's specs and is invitation-only under Project Glasswing, for defensive cybersecurity work; unlike Mythos 5 it runs safety classifiers, so `refusal` handling applies there too. **Legacy but still available:** Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.5. Opus 4.1 retired on 2026-08-05. Anthropic now publishes retirement floors: Fable 5.1 not before 2027-09-01, Opus 5 not before 2027-07-24, Sonnet 5 not before 2027-06-30, Haiku 4.5 not before 2026-10-15.

Model IDs from the 4.6 generation onward are **dateless but still pinned snapshots**, not evergreen pointers. Query `client.models.list()` / `.retrieve(id)` for live `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and `capabilities` rather than hardcoding a table like this one.

**What Fable 5.1 changes for architects** (the same API surface as Fable 5, plus three breaking changes — details in Domain 2 §2.3, Domain 4 §4.7, Domain 5 §5.7):

1. `tool_choice: "any"` and `{"type": "tool", ...}` return **400**. Use `auto` plus an explicit instruction, `strict: true`, or structured outputs.
2. Thinking blocks are readable only by the model that produced them or a newer one — a fallback or router switch to an older model silently drops them (unbilled) and that model re-plans.
3. Editing, reordering, or removing earlier turns invalidates every later thinking block. Harnesses must be **append-only**: freeze `system` and `tools`, move mid-session changes into `role: "system"` messages, and trim context server-side (compaction / context editing) rather than on the client.

Fable 5.1 also requires 30-day data retention (no zero-data-retention orgs unless authorized) and is excluded from Priority Tier, as are Opus 5 and Sonnet 5.

> **Docs (since 2026-07):** Anthropic split its documentation. API docs live at `platform.claude.com/docs/en/*`, Claude Code docs at `code.claude.com/docs/en/*`; the old `docs.anthropic.com` URLs still redirect. The SDK was renamed from "Claude Code SDK" to the **Claude Agent SDK** (`pip install claude-agent-sdk`, `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`).
>
> **Program (Exam Guide v1.0, effective July 2026):** four credentials (CCAO-F, CCAR-F, CCAR-P, CCDV-F), proctored via Pearson VUE, registered through the Anthropic Partner Academy. $125 for CCAR-F, 12-month validity — superseding the launch-period "$99 / first 5,000 partner employees free" terms.

## The 6 Exam Scenarios

1. **Customer Support Resolution Agent** — Agent SDK, MCP tools, escalation logic
2. **Code Generation with Claude Code** — CLAUDE.md, plan mode, slash commands
3. **Multi-Agent Research System** — Coordinator-subagent patterns, error handling
4. **Developer Productivity with Claude** — Built-in tools, MCP servers, codebase exploration
5. **Claude Code for CI/CD** — Structured output, batch API, multi-pass review
6. **Structured Data Extraction** — JSON schemas, tool_use, validation-retry

## The 10 Critical Anti-Patterns

These show up as wrong answers on the exam:

1. Parsing natural language for loop termination instead of checking `stop_reason`
2. Arbitrary iteration caps as primary stopping mechanism
3. Prompt-based enforcement for critical business rules (should use hooks)
4. Self-reported confidence scores for escalation decisions
5. Sentiment-based escalation (sentiment ≠ complexity)
6. Generic error messages hiding diagnostic context
7. Silently suppressing errors (returning empty results as success)
8. Too many tools per agent (18 vs 4-5 recommended) — see Domain 2 §2.3 for how tool search changes this in the current API
9. Same-session self-review (retains reasoning context bias)
10. Aggregate accuracy metrics masking per-document-type failures

## Key Decision Frameworks

| Decision | Option A | Option B |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Enforcement | **Programmatic hooks** — financial/safety | **Prompt-based** — best-effort |
| Execution mode | **Plan mode** — multi-file, architectural | **Direct** — single-file, obvious |
| tool_choice | **"any"** — guarantee tool call | **Forced** — specific tool first. *Both return 400 on Fable 5.1 / Mythos 5.1* — there, `auto` + instruction + `strict: true`, or `output_config.format` |
| API type | **Synchronous** — blocking workflows | **Batch** — latency-tolerant |
| Error handling | **Structured context** — category, retry, partial | Never generic or silent |
| Escalation | **Immediate** — explicit customer request | **Resolve first** — within capability |
| Code review | **Multi-pass** — large PRs | **Single-pass** — small, focused |
| Context passing | **Always explicit** in subagent prompts | Never rely on auto-inheritance |
| Thinking | **Adaptive** (`{"type": "adaptive"}`) on every current model | `budget_tokens` is removed — 400 on Fable 5.x / Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 / 4.7 / 4.8 |
| Effort | **`high`** (default) then sweep — `xhigh` for the hardest coding/agentic work on Opus 5 / Fable 5.1, and the recommended start on Opus 4.8 / 4.7 | **`low` / `medium`** — subagents, mechanical and routine tasks |
| Tool exposure | **Load upfront** — under ~10 tools | **Tool search + `defer_loading`** — 10+ tools or multi-server MCP |
| Context reduction | **Clear** (context editing) — verbose tool results | **Compact** — long conversations that need their narrative |
| State that must persist | **Memory tool / files** | Never rely on the conversation surviving compaction |
| Agent harness | **Tool Runner / Agent SDK** — you host | **Managed Agents** — Anthropic hosts loop + sandbox |
| Conversation history | **Append-only** — freeze `system`/`tools`, changes via `role: "system"` messages | Never edit or snip earlier turns on Fable 5.1 — it invalidates thinking blocks |
| Many-agent orchestration (Claude Code) | **Subagents / forks** — a few delegated tasks per turn | **Dynamic workflows** — a script the runtime executes for dozens to hundreds of agents |

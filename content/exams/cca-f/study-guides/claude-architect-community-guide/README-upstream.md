# Claude Certified Architect — Foundations Study Guide

Unofficial study guide for the **Claude Certified Architect — Foundations** (CCAR-F) certification exam by Anthropic.

This guide covers all 5 exam domains with detailed explanations, code examples, anti-patterns, decision frameworks, and practice questions.

It is actively maintained and updated regularly to track changes to Anthropic's models, APIs, and Claude Code. **Last refresh: September 2026** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed and when.

## The Claude Certification Family

Anthropic now runs **four** certifications. This repo's deep-dive guide covers CCAR-F; overview guides for the other three (sourced from the official v1.0 exam guides) live in [`certs/`](certs/):

| Code | Credential | Audience | Fee | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CCAO-F | Associate — Foundations | Business / productivity users (non-developer) | $99 | [Overview](certs/ccao-f-associate.md) |
| **CCAR-F** | **Architect — Foundations** | **Solution architects** | **$125** | **[Full study guide](claude-certified-architect.md) — this repo's main guide** |
| CCAR-P | Architect — Professional | Senior architects owning the full solution lifecycle | $175 | [Overview](certs/ccar-p-architect-professional.md) |
| CCDV-F | Developer — Foundations | Engineers shipping Claude apps, agents, and workflows | $125 | [Overview](certs/ccdv-f-developer.md) |

All four are 120-minute proctored exams delivered via Pearson VUE, passing score 720/1,000, credentials valid 12 months (Exam Guides v1.0, effective July 2026). Renewal is free if done on time: review what changed and pass a non-proctored assessment; a lapsed credential means sitting the full exam again. Registration needs a partner-domain email — personal addresses are rejected.

The landing page and PDF are built and deployed automatically from this repo's markdown on every push to `main` (see [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml)). The PDF is generated from the source `.md` files, so it never drifts from the guide.

## Exam Overview

- **Passing score**: 720/1000
- **Scenarios**: 4 of 6 randomly selected per exam
- **Delivery**: Pearson VUE (OnVUE online or test center), registered via the Anthropic Partner Academy
- **Price / validity**: $125 per attempt; certification valid 12 months, free on-time renewal via a non-proctored assessment (Exam Guide v1.0, effective July 2026)
- **Target audience**: Solution architects with 6+ months experience building with Claude APIs, Agent SDK, Claude Code, and MCP; access is gated to the Claude Partner Network

## Domains

| Domain | Weight | Guide |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Agentic Architecture & Orchestration | 27% | [Domain 1](domains/d1-agentic-architecture.md) |
| Tool Design & MCP Integration | 18% | [Domain 2](domains/d2-tool-design-mcp.md) |
| Claude Code Configuration & Workflows | 20% | [Domain 3](domains/d3-claude-code-config.md) |

See [claude-certified-architect.md](claude-certified-architect.md) for the full overview including exam scenarios, anti-patterns, decision frameworks, a 4-week study plan, and official resources.

## Model Lineup Used in This Guide

Code samples use **`claude-opus-5`** — Anthropic's current default for complex agentic coding and enterprise work.

| Model | ID | Context | Max output | Price (in / out per MTok) |
|-------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Claude Fable 5.1 | `claude-fable-5-1` | 1M | 128k | $10 / $50 (cache reads $0.25) |
| **Claude Opus 5** | `claude-opus-5` | 1M | 128k | $5 / $25 |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `claude-sonnet-5` | 1M | 128k | $2 / $10 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | 200k | 64k | $1 / $5 |

Fable 5, Opus 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, and Sonnet 4.5 are legacy but still available (Opus 4.1 retired 2026-08-05). Fable 5.1 (released 2026-09-01) rejects forced `tool_choice` and binds thinking blocks to the model and history that produced them — see the [main guide](claude-certified-architect.md#current-model-lineup-september-2026).

## Credits

This guide was inspired by and based on the exam breakdown by [@hooeem on X](https://x.com/hooeem/status/2033198345045336559). Full credit to them for compiling the domain coverage, scenarios, and key concepts from the official exam guide.

## Related work

I'm also building open-source tools around persistent agents, structured memory, and Claude Code usage visibility — same problem space as the agentic / MCP / context domains in this guide, different angle:

- **[recall-echo](https://github.com/dnacenta/recall-echo)** — persistent, confidence-weighted memory for coding agents (MCP-friendly). Early but usable.
- **[pulse-null](https://github.com/dnacenta/pulse-null)** — single-binary scaffold for longer-running AI entities. Research prototype — expect bugs.
- **[pulse-limits](https://github.com/pulse-null/pulse-limits)** — Claude, Codex and Grok plan limits as a retro patient monitor: macOS menu bar, Waybar, terminal. One Rust binary. `brew install pulse-null/tap/pulse-limits && pulse-limits install`. No account, no server — it reuses the logins your CLIs already keep.

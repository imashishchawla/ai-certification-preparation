## Take the deck with you

[flashcards.tsv](../flashcards.tsv) imports directly into Anki, Quizlet, or RemNote: three tab-separated columns, front, back, and tags, so you can study one certification or one topic at a time.

> [!TIP]
> In Anki, choose File, then Import, select the file, set the field separator to Tab, and map the third column to Tags. Filter by a tag such as `developer-foundations` or `policy` to drill one area.

| Glossary: Item | An exam question. Multiple-choice items have one best answer; multiple-response items state how many responses to select |
| Glossary: Scenario-based exam | The Architect Foundations format: 4 scenarios drawn from a published bank of 6, each framing a set of items |
| Glossary: Exam form | A specific assembled version of an exam; forms vary slightly, which scaled scoring corrects for |
